Free Dice Links for Monopoly GO in February 2025
There are a ton of free dice links available in Monopoly GO, with new ones dropping nearly every day. I’ve compiled a list of them for you, which you can access below, but before you get started make sure that you’re on the device that you normally play the game on. Once you’ve clicked, you’ll end up in the Monopoly GO app, where you can claim your reward for doing nothing at all, which is very nice. Also, there is a chance that you may sometimes receive slightly different rewards than those listed below based on your player level.

In some cases, there may also be tokens available for other events going on, such as Partner Events. As such, you should also make sure to check back here if you end up looking for those, as a ton of Puzzle Piece tokens were available, for example, during the “Gift Partners” event.

Why Should I Use Dice Links?
Dice links are going to be a massive help while you’re playing Monopoly GO, as dice rolls are the main mechanic through which you get everything. That means these dice links are going to help you do better at events like Tycoon Empire, as they’ll allow you to hit the various milestones and rewards available during them.


Why Aren’t Your Free Dice Links Working?
An image from Monopoly GO saying that a dice link has already been claimed as part of an article on all the free, safe ones available right now.
If you’ve clicked on one of the above links and it’s not giving you your free dice or other reward, there are a few reasons that might be happening. Sometimes, those links have expired, and though we pull those down as fast as we can, it’s possible we’ve missed one or are asleep. The older a link is, the more likely it’s expired.


Assuming the link is still active, you may have already claimed your free dice. Generally, the game will pop up a message that says “This reward has already been claimed,” if that’s the case. Since these dice links are the same ones used and posted in various Monopoly GO communities, websites, and forums, it’s entirely possible you’ve claimed one already. These links are made by Scopely, the company behind Monopoly GO, and are put out into the world by them.

Also, you have to have already unlocked Albums in Monopoly GO to claim free links. That happens at level 15. It doesn’t take long to reach that point, but if you’ve only just started playing, it’s possible you simply can’t claim them yet.


How to Stay Safe
Something to keep in mind is that people posting mysterious links online that you then click on is a great way to end up with a virus or worse. That means you need to exercise a lot of caution to stay safe. Firstly, only use reputable websites you recognize and trust. If you don’t recognize the name at all, Google it and make sure it’s legitimate. The Escapist, for example, has been covering video games and media since 2005. Giving you a virus absolutely isn’t something we do here.

Secondly, avoid clicking on random links on X, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, or any other social media app. It’s very easy for a bad actor to hide a malicious link on one of those platforms.

There are a lot of great communities that have sprung up around Monopoly GO that are worth checking out if you’re really looking to maximize how many free dice links you get. The game’s official Facebook page is a great hub, and I’ve always been a big fan of this Monopoly GO Discord.

How to Get Free Dice Rolls in Monopoly GO
There are a few other ways to get free dice in Monopoly GO outside of those links. There’s a bonus for connecting your account to Facebook and inviting friends to the game, as well as adding your Contacts list. You can also collect a number of rewards by going to Friends -> Timeline and hitting “Claim All,” which a lot of people miss.

You can also get free dice in the game by collecting your Free Gift, which refreshes every eight hours, or by doing your daily Quick Wins. Doing enough Quick Wins will net you Weekly Prizes, which also include dice rolls and other goodies. Otherwise, Free Parking will occasionally collect a pile of free dice rolls, and you can get some by landing on Go to Jail and rolling doubles while there. There are also bargains that pop up, such as “Endless Offer,” that can give you free dice rolls to try and entice you into spending money in the app.

Finally, you can get a lot of free dice just by playing the game. Finishing albums, increasing your net worth, and finishing off a board will all give you more to roll in Monopoly GO.

And that’s our guide to today’s free dice links in Monopoly GO as well as some other nice ways to get rolls in the mobile game.

In my honest opinion I think you guys suck at updating the dice. You never update it at the times that you post. Other than that I like getting free dice.
